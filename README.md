## Usage

Run `labelme --help` for detail.  
The annotations are saved as a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) file.

```bash
labelme  # just open gui

# tutorial (single image example)
cd examples/tutorial
labelme apc2016_obj3.jpg  # specify image file
labelme apc2016_obj3.jpg -O apc2016_obj3.json  # close window after the save
labelme apc2016_obj3.jpg --nodata  # not include image data but relative image path in JSON file
labelme apc2016_obj3.jpg \
  --labels highland_6539_self_stick_notes,mead_index_cards,kong_air_dog_squeakair_tennis_ball  # specify label list

# semantic segmentation example
cd examples/semantic_segmentation
labelme data_annotated/  # Open directory to annotate all images in it
labelme data_annotated/ --labels labels.txt  # specify label list with a file
```

For more advanced usage, please refer to the examples:

* [Instance Segmentation Example](examples/instance_segmentation)
* [Video Annotation Example](examples/video_annotation)

### Command Line Arguments
- `--output` specifies the location that annotations will be written to. If the location ends with .json, a single annotation will be written to this file. Only one image can be annotated if a location is specified with .json. If the location does not end with .json, the program will assume it is a directory. Annotations will be stored in this directory with a name that corresponds to the image that the annotation was made on.
- The first time you run labelme, it will create a config file in `~/.labelmerc`. You can edit this file and the changes will be applied the next time that you launch labelme. If you would prefer to use a config file from another location, you can specify this file with the `--config` flag.
- Without the `--nosortlabels` flag, the program will list labels in alphabetical order. When the program is run with this flag, it will display labels in the order that they are provided.
- Flags are assigned to an entire image. [Example](examples/classification)
- Labels are assigned to a single polygon. [Example](examples/bbox_detection)

## Testing

```bash
pip install hacking pytest pytest-qt
flake8 .
pytest -v tests
```


## Developing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme.git
cd labelme

# Install anaconda3 and labelme
curl -L https://github.com/wkentaro/dotfiles/raw/master/local/bin/install_anaconda3.sh | bash -s .
source .anaconda3/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```


## How to build standalone executable

Below shows how to build the standalone executable on macOS, Linux and Windows.  
Also, there are pre-built executables in
[the release section](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases).

```bash
# Setup conda
conda create --name labelme python==3.6.0
conda activate labelme

# Build the standalone executable
pip install .
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller labelme.spec
dist/labelme --version
```
